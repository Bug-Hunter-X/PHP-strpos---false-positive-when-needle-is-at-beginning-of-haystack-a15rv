This code suffers from a subtle issue related to PHP's type juggling and comparison operators.  The `strpos()` function returns `false` if the needle is not found, and `0` if it's found at the beginning of the haystack.  Since `false` is loosely equivalent to `0` in PHP, the comparison `strpos($haystack, $needle) != 0` will incorrectly evaluate to `true` even if the needle is found at the beginning.

```php
$haystack = "This is a test string";
$needle = "This";

if (strpos($haystack, $needle) != 0) {
    echo "Needle not found";
} else {
    echo "Needle found";
}
```

This will print "Needle not found", even though "This" is clearly at the beginning.
